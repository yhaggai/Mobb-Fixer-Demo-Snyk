# Mobb Fixer for GitHub - Demo
### A demo repo showing how Mobb Fixer for GitHub works

[Mobb Fixer](https://app.mobb.ai/github-fixer) monitors your pull requests for security issues and produces accurate code fix suggestions on the spot.

Click below to see how automatic fixes on pull requests work:

\
\
\
This will let you start a pull request from branch `introduce-new-security-issue` to branch `main`.

Once the PR is created, Snyk will automatically start a code security scan and report an issue.

Mobb Fixer will immediately run and present a fix suggestion in the PR conversation tab.

> [!TIP]
> To commit the suggested code change to the pull request, simply click on ***Commit fix***. Security scan will run again immediately and flag the issue as "Fixed".
