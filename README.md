# Mobb Fixer for GitHub - Demo
### A demo repo showing how Mobb Fixer for GitHub works

[Mobb Fixer](https://app.mobb.ai/github-fixer) monitors your pull requests for security issues and produces accurate code fix suggestions on the spot.
\
\
\
See how automatic fixes on pull requests work:

[<img width="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/tomer-mobb/Mobb-Fixer-Demo-CodeQL/assets/132216976/12a95453-f72e-4cf0-932f-db5f3be405a2">](/../../compare/main...introduce-new-security-issue)
\
\
\
This will let you start a pull request from branch `introduce-new-security-issue` to branch `main`.

Once the PR is created, GitHub CodeQL will automatically start a security scan and report an issue.

Mobb Fixer will immediately run and present a fix suggestion in the PR conversation tab.

> [!TIP]
> To commit the suggested code change to the pull request, simply click on ***Commit fix***, and the fix will be commited. Security scan will run again immediately and flag the issue as "Fixed".
